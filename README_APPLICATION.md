## Data Schema

The application works with customer transaction data containing the following features:

| Feature | Description | Type |
|---------|-------------|------|
| Fresh | Annual spending on fresh products | Numeric |
| Milk | Annual spending on milk products | Numeric |
| Grocery | Annual spending on grocery items | Numeric |
| Frozen | Annual spending on frozen products | Numeric |
| Detergents_Paper | Annual spending on detergents and paper products | Numeric |
| Delicatessen | Annual spending on delicatessen products | Numeric |

## Clustering Algorithms

### K-Means Clustering
- **Best for**: Well-separated, spherical clusters
- **Parameters**: Number of clusters (k)
- **Use case**: When you have a rough idea of the number of market segments

### DBSCAN
- **Best for**: Irregularly shaped clusters and outlier detection
- **Parameters**: Epsilon (neighborhood radius), minimum samples
- **Use case**: When cluster shapes are unknown and outliers need identification

### Hierarchical Clustering
- **Best for**: Understanding cluster relationships and hierarchies
- **Parameters**: Number of clusters, linkage method
- **Use case**: When you want to understand how segments relate to each other

## Segment Interpretation

The application generates detailed profiles for each customer segment:

### Segment Characteristics
- **Size**: Number of customers in the segment
- **Percentage**: Market share of the segment
- **Dominant Features**: Top 3 distinguishing characteristics
- **Spending Patterns**: Average spending across all product categories

### Business Applications
- **Marketing Strategy**: Tailor campaigns to specific segments
- **Product Development**: Focus on high-value categories for each segment
- **Inventory Management**: Optimize stock based on segment preferences
- **Customer Retention**: Develop targeted retention strategies

## API Endpoints

The application provides several REST API endpoints:

| Endpoint | Method | Description |

2. Add the algorithm to the `perform_clustering` method
3. Update the frontend dropdown in `index.html`

### Custom Visualizations
1. Create new visualization functions in the Flask backend
2. Add corresponding API endpoints
3. Update the JavaScript frontend to call the new endpoints

### Styling Modifications
- Edit `static/css/style.css` for visual customizations
- Modify color schemes using CSS custom properties
- Adjust responsive breakpoints for different devices

## Performance Considerations
